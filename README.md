# Rouse
Rouse pairs people with a shared goal - waking up on time. The process is, first, Akshay signs up, inputs when he wants to get up tomorrow, whether he want to be Rouser or a Rousee. Rousers call and shout out Rousees’ dreams. If Akshay chooses Rousee, he will input what goal he wants to be waken up, like “make a positive impact to the world.” Then, all set. Before 9pm the same day, Akshay will be matched with his Rouser, let’s say Annie. Annie has two kinds of information, Akshay’s getting up time and his goal. “Hey, Aksahy, what can you do to make a positive impact to the world?” “Programming!” “How?” “Oh, I have a PennApps to go today.” “What should you do now?” “Get up and go to the airport.” “Just do it.”
